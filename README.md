# Andon
Arduino Smooth Blinking Light "Andon"

The light is usually diffused and softened by paper, called “washi” that is attached to the structure. Washi is a special type of Japanese paper that has high reflectance and a unique texture that is made by thick fibers in the paper. I simply used tracing paper to imitate the diffuser, and it is much smoother than a traditional one. In addition, I placed a laser-cut wood piece with a geometric pattern on top of the light. I made a pattern to look modern. The pattern will become visible in the dark. The flicker of the andon flame is a big part of the visual experience. It gives very relaxing and almost therapeutic feeling. I created the flicker digitally with Arduino. I used to PWM (pulse-width modulation) to control the LEDs’ brightness and made them beat. The slow and smooth beating seems to match to materials, wood and tracing paper. Overall, the lamp is very relaxing and soothing.
